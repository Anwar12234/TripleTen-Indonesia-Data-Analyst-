# Analysis Plan for Prepaid Telecommunications Packages by Megaline

## Pra-pemrosesan Data (Data Preprocessing):

1. Loading and exploring the raw data
2. Handling missing values and converting data types
3. Calculating additional charges and total monthly profit for each user

## Analisis Data Eksploratif (EDA):

1. Visualizing and analyzing the cleaned data
2. Creating histograms to explore user behavior and package usage

## Analisis Data Statistik (Hypothesis Testing):

1. Formulating hypotheses related to user behavior and package effectiveness
2. Performing statistical tests, such as t-tests, to analyze the hypotheses

## Hypotheses:

1. Null Hypothesis (H0): The average monthly profit from "Surf" package users is equal to the average monthly profit from "Ultimate" package users.
2. Alternative Hypothesis (Ha): The average monthly profit from "Surf" package users is significantly different from the average monthly profit from "Ultimate" package users.

## Statistical Tests:

1. Calculate the mean and standard deviation of monthly profits for both packages.
2. Perform a two-sample t-test to compare the means of the two groups.
3. Set a significance level (alpha) to determine statistical significance.
4. Analyze the p-value to make a decision about the null hypothesis.
5. If the p-value is less than alpha, reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant difference in average monthly profits between the two packages.

## Conclusion:

Based on the statistical analysis, determine whether there is a significant difference in average monthly profits between the "Surf" and "Ultimate" packages. Provide insights into the package effectiveness and user behavior.
