# Video Game Sales Analysis

This project is an analysis of video game sales data from 1980 to 2016. The analysis includes data exploration, trend analysis of platform and genre sales, as well as hypothesis testing related to ratings and platform/genre.

## Data Preprocessing

In the data preprocessing stage, the following steps were taken:

1. Handling missing values (NaN) in the user_score column.
2. Removing duplicate data.
3. Calculating total sales across all regions.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

In the exploratory data analysis phase, several key findings were obtained:

1. There is a trend of decreasing game releases after a peak in 2009.
2. The Action genre has the highest number of releases, followed by Sports.
3. The PS2 platform has the highest sales, with a peak in sales in 2004.
4. There are differences in platform and genre preferences among the NA, EU, and JP regions.

## Statistical Data Analysis (Hypothesis Testing)

In the statistical data analysis, hypothesis testing was performed on:

1. The difference in average user ratings between the Xbox One and PC platforms.
2. The difference in average user ratings between the Action and Sports genres.

The testing results indicate that there is a difference in average user ratings between the Xbox One and PC platforms, but there is no difference in average user ratings between the Action and Sports genres.

## Conclusion

This project provides an in-depth understanding of game sales trends, platform preferences, genre preferences, and user ratings in the period from 1980 to 2016. Some key findings include:

- The popularity of game platforms changes over time, with periods of peak popularity followed by declines.
- The Action genre dominates the number of game releases, while the Shooter genre has high sales potential.
- User preferences for games vary among the NA, EU, and JP regions.
- There is a difference in average user ratings between the Xbox One and PC platforms.

This project offers valuable insights for the gaming industry, and further analysis and more recent data may be required for a more accurate understanding.

**Note:** This analysis is based on a sample dataset, and the results may not represent the current situation. Further analysis and updated data may be needed for a more accurate assessment.
