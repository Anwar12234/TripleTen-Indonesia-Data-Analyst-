# Zuber Data Analysis

## Objective

The Zuber Data Analysis project aims to analyze passenger preferences and external factors in ride-sharing journeys for Zuber company in Chicago. By analyzing competitor data and testing hypotheses about the impact of weather on trip frequency, this project aims to provide deeper insights into passenger behavior and the effects of external factors on the ride-sharing service.

## Hypotheses

One of the hypotheses tested in this project is

1. The average trip duration from Loop to O'Hare International Airport changes when it rains on Saturdays.

## Phases

The Zuber Data Analysis project consists of two main phases

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) In this phase, an initial understanding of the data is established through visualization and exploration. Some aspects analyzed include taxi company data, dropoff location data, and top taxi company charts.

2. Statistical Data Analysis (Hypothesis Testing) In this phase, a hypothesis is tested regarding changes in trip duration from Loop to O'Hare International Airport on rainy Saturdays. Using Levene's test and t-test, the results of this hypothesis are evaluated.

## Folder Structure

1. Datasets This folder contains the data files used in the project, including CSV files containing SQL query results.

2. Notebooks This folder contains Python code used for data analysis. In this notebook, both the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Statistical Data Analysis (Hypothesis Testing) phases are conducted.

3. README.md This document, which you are currently reading, provides a brief summary of the Zuber Data Analysis project.

## Analysis Results

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- From the exploratory data analysis, information was found regarding the top taxi companies by trip count and areas with the highest average trip counts.
- Data visualization was performed to gain a better understanding of trends and patterns in the data.

Statistical Data Analysis (Hypothesis Testing)

- Hypothesis testing was conducted to determine whether there is a change in the average trip duration from Loop to O'Hare International Airport on rainy Saturdays.
- By utilizing Levene's test and t-test, it was determined that the hypothesis holds true.

## Conclusion

The Zuber Data Analysis project has provided deeper insights into passenger preferences, top taxi companies, and the influence of weather on trip duration. These analysis results can offer valuable information for the Zuber company to optimize their ride-sharing service in Chicago.
