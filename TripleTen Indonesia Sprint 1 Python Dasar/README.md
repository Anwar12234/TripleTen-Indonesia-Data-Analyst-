## Introduction

In this project, we aim to compare user music preferences between the cities of Springfield and Shelbyville. We will test three hypotheses related to user behavior and music genre preferences in these two cities. The project involves data analysis, data preprocessing, and hypothesis testing.

## Data Overview

We begin by loading and exploring the Y.Music dataset. The dataset contains information about user behavior related to music tracks, including track titles, artists, genres, cities, days of the week, and playtimes. The first step is to assess the data quality and address any issues such as missing values and duplicates.

## Data Preprocessing

During the data preprocessing phase, we clean and format the data for analysis. We address issues such as inconsistent column naming, missing values, and duplicates. The preprocessing ensures that the data is ready for hypothesis testing.

## Hypothesis Testing

We test three hypotheses related to user behavior and music preferences:
1. User activity differs based on the day of the week and city.
2. Music preferences on Monday mornings and Friday nights differ between Springfield and Shelbyville.
3. Genre preferences vary between Springfield and Shelbyville.

We conduct the analysis and present the findings for each hypothesis.

## Findings

The analysis reveals interesting insights into user behavior and music preferences in Springfield and Shelbyville. We compare user activity, genre preferences, and trends across different days of the week.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this project provides insights into user music preferences in the cities of Springfield and Shelbyville. The hypotheses were tested and findings were presented based on the analysis of the Y.Music dataset. The results highlight the similarities and differences in user behavior and music genre preferences between the two cities.
