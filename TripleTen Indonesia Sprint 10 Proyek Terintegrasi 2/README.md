# A/B Testing Analysis on Application Font Change

## Background
In this project, we conduct an A/B testing analysis to evaluate whether a change in font in an application affects user behavior. The font change is implemented to ensure that users remain comfortable and do not experience a decrease in the number of transactions they perform.

## Analysis Steps

### 1. Data Collection
User data from three experimental groups (246, 247, and 248) has been gathered. Groups 246 and 247 use the application with the old font, while group 248 uses the application with the new font.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
The collected user data has been processed to ensure its quality, including removing invalid or duplicate data.

### 3. Calculating User Counts for Each Event
The number of users in each experimental group is calculated to understand user activity within the application.

### 4. Most Popular Events
The most popular events within each experimental group are also identified.

### 5. Conducting A/A Testing
A/A testing is performed between groups 246 and 247 using the old font. No significant differences are found between them.

### 6. Conducting A/B Testing
A/B testing is conducted between group 246 (old font) and group 248 (new font). No significant differences are found between the two.

### 7. Conducting A/B Testing
A/B testing is also conducted between group 247 (old font) and group 248 (new font). No significant differences are found between them.

### 8. Conducting A/A/B Testing
A/A/B testing combines data from groups 246 and 247 (old font) and tests it against group 248 (new font). No significant differences are found among the three groups.

## Conclusion
The results of the statistical tests indicate that the font change from old to new has no impact on the number of transactions performed by users. Therefore, a font update is not necessary, and users remain comfortable with the old font.
